# TCS Codevita 1st round result analysis
This is a data analysis project in which I use downloaded data of the 1st round results for TCS codevita for the last 3 years, clean the data files and analyze them. The main files can be found in the folder 'ipynb notebooks codevita'. 

You can see the final results here https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rwikdutta/codevita_results_analysis/blob/master/ipynb%20notebooks%20codevita/10%29%20Analyzing%20Codevita%20Results.ipynb
