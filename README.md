# TCS Codevita 1st round result analysis
This is a data analysis project in which I use downloaded data of the 1st round results for TCS codevita for the last 3 years, clean the data files and analyze them. The main files can be found in the folder 'ipynb notebooks codevita'. Please note that the 'Tableau Interactive Element' is incomplete as of now


N.B. - More details to be updated soon
